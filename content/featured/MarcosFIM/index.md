This study analyzes President Marcos Jr.’s speeches using Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) to uncover recurring word patterns that reflect evolving policy priorities. By segmenting speeches into sentences and applying maximal itemset analysis, we identified key thematic clusters and tracked their shifts from 2022 to 2025. The results reveal a transition from national identity and post-pandemic recovery to emerging focuses on infrastructure, diplomacy, and security—highlighting how linguistic patterns can signal strategic policy shifts over time.
