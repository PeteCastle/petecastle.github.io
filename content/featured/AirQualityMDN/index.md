This study presents a probabilistic air pollution forecasting framework using [Mixture Density Networks (MDNs)](https://medium.com/data-science/predicting-the-unpredictable-905f634acc20) combined with various sequential models (RNN, GRU, LSTM, TCN, Transformer). Trained on hourly air quality data from Metro Manila, the GRU-MDN architecture emerged as the most effective, offering well-calibrated predictive distributions and the lowest validation loss (â€“4.73). Compared to traditional RNN baselines and deterministic approaches, MDNs more accurately capture uncertainty and temporal variability in pollutants like CO and NO, enabling risk-aware and interpretable forecasts for environmental decision-making.
