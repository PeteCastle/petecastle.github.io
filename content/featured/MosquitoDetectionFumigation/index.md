Integrates computer science, machine learning, Arduino development, and entomology to address mosquito-related challenges in the Philippines. [Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network](https://medium.com/@soumyajitdatta123/faster-rcnns-explained-af76f96a0b70) model for real-time mosquito detection is developed, with a web-based interface for data visualization and an automated fumigation system triggered by detection.
