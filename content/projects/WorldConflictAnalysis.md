The UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global provides a comprehensive repository of data on global conflict events, yet struggles to gain visibility in mainstream media. This lack of awareness hinders public understanding of the scale and impact of conflicts worldwide.  Bridging the gap between the dataset and media through effective visualizations and targeted dissemination is crucial for fostering empathy, informed decision-making, and engagement in conflict resolution efforts.
