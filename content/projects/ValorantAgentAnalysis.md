This study uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify key performance patterns in Valorant matches and recommend optimal agent compositions. By analyzing player data across maps and metrics beyond traditional KDA, the research builds a data-driven framework for agent selection. The results highlight eight principal components that capture diverse playstyles, improving strategy and player evaluation.
