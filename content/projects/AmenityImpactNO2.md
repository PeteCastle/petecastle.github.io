This study uses machine learning and geospatial data to examine how urban amenities affect air quality across 138 Philippine cities. It identifies specific amenities such as schools that are associated with varying AQI levels, and employs counterfactual analysis to simulate how adjusting these features could improve air quality. The findings offer data-driven insights for sustainable urban planning and zoning policies.
