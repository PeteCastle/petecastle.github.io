This study analyzes how urban amenities influence air quality in Philippine cities using machine learning and geospatial data. By identifying key amenities linked to poor AQI and simulating planning interventions, it offers actionable insights for sustainable urban design. Results show that amenities like bars and fast food correlate with worse air quality, while schools and green spaces are linked to better conditions.
