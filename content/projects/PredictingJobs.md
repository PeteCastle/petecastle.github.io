This study explores whether job industry and employment type can be predicted from job descriptions using multi-output classification. Results show that simpler models assuming label independence perform comparably to more complex dependent models, aligning with statistical tests indicating weak label associations. Logistic Regression outperformed other classifiers, with dimensionality reduction aiding performance.
